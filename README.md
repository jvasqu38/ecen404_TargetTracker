# ecen404_TargetTracker
Target Tracker System for senior design.

This project's purpose is to keep track of the bulletholes on a target. 
The file watcher.py monitors the directory in which it is in for new files. The purpose of watcher.py is to wait for new images
of the target and activate the image processing code using the new images as input.
